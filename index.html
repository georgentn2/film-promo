            <p>
                Don Vito Corelone, "The Godfather" is one of the most iconic film characters of all time, played by Marlon Brando. He is an Italian immigrant of Sicilian origin who has built an organized crime empire in New York. In his autobiography, Marlon Brando described
                Don Corleone as "a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats... I saw him as a man of substance, tradition, dignity, refinement, a man of unerring instinct who just happened to live in a violent world and who
                had to protect himself and his family in this environment". We can watch this movie several times just to view his elegant screen presence and extra-ordinary acting perfomance.
