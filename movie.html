        The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola.
        The film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a powerful New York crime family, based on Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name.
        The plot, which spans the years 1945 to 1955, focuses on Michael Corleone's (Pacino) transformation from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, while also chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando).
        The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in history and one of the most influential, particularly in the gangster genre.The American Film Institute now ranks it as the second greatest film in American history (behind Citizen Kane), and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. 
        For a time, it was the highest-grossing film ever made, and it still holds the box office record for 1972. It won three Academy Awards that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was nominated for Best Director.
